A man walks into a CSC347 tutorial with his dog, and says "I'll bet anyone here $10 that my dog can talk".

The TA takes the bet and the man says to the dog "Go on, boy, talk!"

But the dog says nothing.

The TA says "Maybe he'll talk to me". He looks at the dog. "Hey boy, what's your name?"

But the dog says nothing.

The man tries once more. "Come on, buddy. Talk! Like you did outside!"

But the dog says nothing.

The man, flush with embarrassment, pays up the tenner, picks up his dog and heads to the local park.

"What was that about, dude?" The man says, wiping tears from his eyes. "You really embarrassed me back there"

The dog looks at the man and says "Tomorrow, you'll bet $100"
